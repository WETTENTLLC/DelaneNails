            <div class="floating-frame">
                <p>Delane's Natural Nails specializes in taking care of your natural nails, hands, and feet. Your experience in nail care should be relaxing, safe, and nurturing in a clean environment. That is what you will receive at Delane’s Natural Nail Care—a sanctuary of love, care, and community.</p>
                <p>Delane’s journey into the world of nail care began in 1995, but her passion for specialized pedicures was deeply inspired by her grandfather, Andrew Frank Hatch. At 117 (or 118, as he would proudly say), he was one of the oldest men to live in the United States. His inability to walk freely in his later years due to foot health struggles moved Delane deeply. She realized that proper foot care could have allowed him to continue walking freely until almost 114. This revelation gave her a new purpose: to create specialized pedicures that not only beautify but also restore and maintain the health of feet, ensuring her clients can move freely and comfortably for as long as possible.</p>
                <p>Delane’s Natural Nail Care is built on the foundation of love and wisdom she learned from her grandfather. His teachings about caring for others, the importance of community, and the power of love are woven into every aspect of her business. From her specialized pedicures to her mentorship programs, Delane’s mission is to spread the same care and compassion she received growing up.</p>
                <p>One of Delane’s proudest achievements is her mentorship program, <strong>Steps to Success</strong>. Inspired by her grandfather’s legacy of wisdom and guidance, Delane created this program to empower young women. Through mentorship, she shares her knowledge, experience, and love, helping them navigate their own paths to success. Delane believes that mentorship is not just about teaching skills but about fostering confidence, resilience, and a sense of belonging. Many of the young women she mentors have gone on to achieve their dreams, and Delane considers this one of her greatest joys.</p>

                <p>Not only do we care about the health and beautification of your hands and feet, but we also care about the pampering of your soul. Delane’s Natural Nail Care is more than a business—it’s a family. Myeshia, Delane’s co-owner, is a testament to this. She is not just a business partner but a daughter, friend, and companion. Together, they have created a space where everyone who walks through the door feels like part of the family.</p>
                <p>Delane’s ability to create extended family wherever she goes is a testament to her generous spirit. Whether through her specialized pedicures, her mentorship programs like <strong>Steps to Success</strong>, or the warm, loving atmosphere she cultivates, Delane continues to touch lives and inspire others to care deeply and love fiercely.</p>
                <p>Thank you for being part of this journey. Whether you’re a longtime client or a new friend, Delane welcomes you with open arms and a heart full of love.</p>
