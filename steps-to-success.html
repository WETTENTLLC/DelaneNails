                <h2>About DNNC Steps to Success</h2>
                <p><strong>DNNC Steps to Success (DNNC STS)</strong> began organically in 2000 in Oakland, CA, and was formalized with a fiscal sponsor in 2016. This transformative initiative works in partnership with Delane's Natural Nail Care to empower and nurture the growth and development of underserved women, with a special focus on African American single parents in the Bay Area.</p>

                <p>Did you know?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Of the 10 million low-income working families with children in the U.S., 39% are headed by single working mothers—approximately 4.1 million families.</li>
                    <li>Single-parent families are among the poorest in the nation, making them extremely vulnerable to homelessness.</li>
                    <li>Over 75% of all homeless families nationwide are headed by single women with children.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These statistics, along with Delane’s own life experience as a former homeless single mother, drive the mission of STS. Delane understands the challenges these women face and has dedicated her life to providing them with the tools and opportunities they need to thrive.</p>

                <h3>Our Impact</h3>
                <p>DNNC Steps to Success is designed to prevent homelessness, poverty, and poor health by addressing root causes and providing systemic support. We focus specifically on African American single parents in the Bay Area, providing comprehensive support that changes lives.</p>
                
                <p>Our hands-on daily support has led to advanced careers, more effective parenting, and lasting positive change for women and children. STS provides vocational training as manicurists, a trade that allows women to earn a living wage in less than one year. Graduates of the program not only gain financial independence but also develop the confidence and skills needed to build better lives for themselves and their children. Well-resourced single mothers become more effective parents, changing the trajectory of their families for generations to come.</p>
                
                <h3>How to Support:</h3>
                <p>Your support can make a difference. By donating to STS, you are helping to break the cycle of poverty and homelessness for single mothers and their children. We are donor-supported and regularly share success stories of families whose lives have been positively changed.</p>
