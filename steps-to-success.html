                <p><strong>Steps to Success (STS)</strong>, started in 1999 and formalized in June 2016, is a transformative initiative that works in partnership with Delane's Natural Nail Care to empower and nurture the growth and development of underserved women. Through social skills training, vocational education, and mentorship, STS aims to create a positive change in the lives of participants and their children.</p>

                <p>Did you know?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Of the 10 million low-income working families with children in the U.S., 39% are headed by single working mothers—approximately 4.1 million families.</li>
                    <li>Single-parent families are among the poorest in the nation, making them extremely vulnerable to homelessness.</li>
                    <li>Over 75% of all homeless families nationwide are headed by single women with children.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These statistics, along with Delane’s own life experience as a former homeless single mother, drive the mission of STS. Delane understands the challenges these women face and has dedicated her life to providing them with the tools and opportunities they need to thrive.</p>

                <p>STS provides vocational training as manicurists, a trade that allows women to earn a living wage in less than one year. Graduates of the program not only gain financial independence but also develop the confidence and skills needed to build better lives for themselves and their children. Well-resourced single mothers become more effective parents, changing the trajectory of their families for generations to come.</p>
                <p>Your support can make a difference. By donating to STS, you are helping to break the cycle of poverty and homelessness for single mothers and their children. Together, we can create a brighter future for these families.</p>
