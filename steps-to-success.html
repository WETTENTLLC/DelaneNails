            <div class="floating-frame">
                <p>Delane's Natural Nails specializes in taking care of your natural nails, hands, and feet. Your experience in nail care should be relaxing, safe, and nurturing in a clean environment. That is what you will receive at Delane’s Natural Nail Care—a sanctuary of love, care, and community.</p>
                <p>Delane’s journey into the world of nail care began in 1995, but her passion for specialized pedicures was deeply inspired by her grandfather, Andrew Frank Hatch. At 117 (or 118, as he would proudly say), he was one of the oldest men to live in the United States. His inability to walk freely in his later years due to foot health struggles moved Delane deeply. She realized that proper foot care could have allowed him to continue walking freely until almost 114. This revelation gave her a new purpose: to create specialized pedicures that not only beautify but also restore and maintain the health of feet, ensuring her clients can move freely and comfortably for as long as possible.</p>
                <p>Delane’s Natural Nail Care is built on the foundation of love and wisdom she learned from her grandfather. His teachings about caring for others, the importance of community, and the power of love are woven into every aspect of her business. From her specialized pedicures to her mentorship programs, Delane’s mission is to spread the same care and compassion she received growing up.</p>

                <p>Not only do we care about the health and beautification of your hands and feet, but we also care about the pampering of your soul. Delane’s Natural Nail Care is more than a business—it’s a family. Myeshia, Delane’s co-owner, is a testament to this. She is not just a business partner but a daughter, friend, and companion. Together, they have created a space where everyone who walks through the door feels like part of the family.</p>
                <p>Delane’s ability to create extended family wherever she goes is a testament to her generous spirit. Whether through her specialized pedicures, her mentorship programs like <strong>Steps to Success</strong>, or the warm, loving atmosphere she cultivates, Delane continues to touch lives and inspire others to care deeply and love fiercely.</p>

            <div class="floating-frame">
                <p><strong>Steps to Success (STS)</strong>, started in 1999 and formalized in June 2016, is a transformative initiative that works in partnership with Delane's Natural Nail Care to empower and nurture the growth and development of underserved women. Through social skills training, vocational education, and mentorship, STS aims to create a positive change in the lives of participants and their children.</p>

                <p>Did you know?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Of the 10 million low-income working families with children in the U.S., 39% are headed by single working mothers—approximately 4.1 million families.</li>
                    <li>Single-parent families are among the poorest in the nation, making them extremely vulnerable to homelessness.</li>
                    <li>Over 75% of all homeless families nationwide are headed by single women with children.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These statistics, along with Delane’s own life experience as a former homeless single mother, drive the mission of STS. Delane understands the challenges these women face and has dedicated her life to providing them with the tools and opportunities they need to thrive.</p>

                <p>STS provides vocational training as manicurists, a trade that allows women to earn a living wage in less than one year. Graduates of the program not only gain financial independence but also develop the confidence and skills needed to build better lives for themselves and their children. Well-resourced single mothers become more effective parents, changing the trajectory of their families for generations to come.</p>
                <p>Your support can make a difference. By donating to STS, you are helping to break the cycle of poverty and homelessness for single mothers and their children. Together, we can create a brighter future for these families.</p>
